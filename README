Mail::SNCF

This module is designed for the users of the French rail company
website. It provides a parser for messages sent after booking on the
website. Its goal is to summarize information in a format readable by
agenda programs. Backends for ICal, Remind and a pretty text output are
provided.

To use it, you should say your MDA to redirect messages sent by SNCF to
some mailbox and run the script sncf onto it. See the help of this
script for more information.
